My experience has been generally positive: most queries run a little bit faster than through SQLite on my CPU and the integration with VSCode is seamless. However, I would not recommend it in general to a fellow student or co-worker for 2 reasons. Firstly, Microsoft is not a charity which generously donates computational resources, hence the service has a cost. While this cost may be justifiable for complex database requirements with frequent queries, this is unlikely to be the case for projects of a scope suitable to local hosting (such as CSE 414 HW2). My Alder Lake-P CPU was satisfactory for all of the SQLite queries in HW1 and HW2. Secondly, having a third-party hosting your data presents obvious privacy concerns as well as the potential for denied access to your own data. Microsoft can afford better lawyers than a fellow student. If the company employing my co-worker and I can afford even better lawyers than Microsoft, they can afford to self-host and avoid the aforementioned concerns.
